                            Hello, World! My name is Rifky Aliffa. I am a Full
                            Stack Developer, Software Engineer, and Data
                            Scientist, in short I'm a
                            <strong>Programmer</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Madison believes mindfulness in the workplace is key
                            to success - a tenet he lives out through her
                            interests in yoga, meditation, gardening, and
                            painting. Madison is currently working as a
                            freelance marketing director and is always
                            interested in a challenge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her hunger for knowledge and determination to turn
                            information into action has contributed to her most
                            recent success at Rockwell Group, where she led
                            international, award-winning campaigns for
                            heavy-hitting brands, such as Puma, Gucci, and
                            Rolex. Meanwhile, she vastly improved the
                            productivity of her team by implementing strategic
                            project management methods and ensuring a work-life
                            balance for her department.
